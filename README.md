Robert Hans van Gulik was an orientalist, diplomat, musician (of Chinese Lute, or say, guqin), and writer. 

He is best known for his detective novels about Dee Goong in Tang dynasty. However, that's not the work which makes me come to know him. What makes me attracted to his life and work is the book, Lore of the Chinese Lute, a collection of research paper on guqin by him. In that book, he delicately used a phrase as 'painting with sound', which became well-known by guqin musicians later, to describe the quality of the sound of guqin.
