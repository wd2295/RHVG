Robert Hans van Gulik was an orientalist, diplomat, musician (of Chinese Lute, or say, guqin), and writer. 

He is best known for his detective novels about Dee Goong in Tang dynasty. However, that's not the work which makes me come to know him. What makes me attracted to his life and work is the book, Lore of the Chinese Lute, a collection of research paper on guqin by him. In that book, he delicately used a phrase as 'painting with sound', which became well-known by guqin musicians later, to describe the quality of the sound of guqin.

R.H. van Gulik was not only expertised in Chinese culture such as detective stories about Dee Goong who was an outstanding official in Tang dynasty and guqin which was the favorite musical instrument of the intellectual in ancient China, but also an expert about Japan. He worked in the Dutch Foreign Service and served as a diplomat in Japan before the outbreak of war between Japan and his hometown Netherland in WW2.
